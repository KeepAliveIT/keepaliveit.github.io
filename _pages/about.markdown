### How much does Keep-Alive I.T charge for its I.T services?
We believe being transparent and open about pricing to our potential and current customers is important. That's why we've tried being as accurate as possible on our website's service pages to give you an approximate price for the service on offer. This means you can easily get a good ballpark figure of our service costs ahead of time, avoiding you any nasty surprises at the end of our time working together and allowing you to shop around if you're not happy with the quote we've provided to you.

Please note: Some services will require further analysis into your requirements before we are able to agree on a definite price for the work that needs completing. This is the nature of consultancy services and you should expect custom quotes from us *before* we start working for you.
