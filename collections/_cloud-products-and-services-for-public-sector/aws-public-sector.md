    <h2>An Introduction to AWS</h2>
    <h3>What exactly is AWS and why should most Public Sector Organisations be using it?</h3>
    <p>
        <iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dH0yz-Osy54?controls=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </p>
    
    <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is one of the World's leading Cloud Computing providers. Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources via the internet, with a pay-as-you-go pricing model.</p>
    
    <p>Amazon Web Services works like this; Instead of buying, owning and maintaining physical data centers and servers on-site, you can access a gigantic pool of technology resources, such as computing power, storage and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS focuses on the setup of complex infrastructure sites across the globe, and all a Public Sector Organisation has to do to reap the benefits of a Public Cloud provider is hire a specialised team of I.T professionals to Architect, Operate, and Maintain Cloud based I.T workloads. It can often be tricky to find AWS Cloud Consultants due to the amount of technical expertise required. However, that shouldn't put Public Sector Organisations off using Cloud technologies as there are companies like Keep-Alive I.T around to help with this.</p>
    
  <p>Organisations of every type, size and industry are using the cloud for a wide variety of use cases, such as data backup, disaster recovery, email, virtual desktops, software development and testing, big data analytics, and customer facing web applications. Public Sector Organisations could be reaping the benefits that an AWS Cloud offers to give a better experience to the public and to save thousands of pounds on I.T operation costs.</p>
    
    <div class="divider div-transparent div-arrow-down"></div>
    
    <h3>How secure is it to run Public Sector I.T workloads on Amazon Web Services (AWS)?</h3>
    <p>The IT infrastructure that AWS provides to its customers is designed and managed in alignment with best security practices and a variety of IT security standards. The following is a partial list of assurance programs with which AWS complies:
    
    SOC 1/ISAE 3402, SOC 2, SOC 3
    
    FISMA, DIACAP, and FedRAMP
    
    PCI DSS Level 1
    
    ISO 9001, ISO 27001, ISO 27017, ISO 27018
    <p>
    <div class="divider div-transparent div-arrow-down"></div>
    
    <h3>How should my Public Sector Organisation take an approach to moving I.T workloads to Amazon Web Services (AWS)?</h3>
    
    <p>Using AWS is a decision that must be made higher up in a Public Sector organisation.
    
    With cloud computing your business can become more agile, reduce costs, instantly scale, and deploy globally in minutes.
    
    Cloud computing gives you instance access to a broad range of technologies so you can innovate faster and build nearly anything you can imagine, from infrastructure services such as compute, storage and databases, to Internet of Things, machine learning, data analytics, and much more.
    
    You can deploy technology services in a matter of minutes and get from idea to implementation several orders of magnitude
    faster than before.
    
    This gives you the freedom to experiment and test new ideas to differentiate customer experiences and transform your business, such as adding machine learning and intelligence to your applications in order to personalize experiences for your customers and
    improve their engagement.
    
    You don't need to make large, upfront investments in hardware and overpay for capacity you don't use.
    
    Instead you can trade capital expense for variable expense and only pay for IT as you consume it.
    
    With cloud computing you access resources from the cloud in real time as they're needed.
    
    You can scale these resources up and down to grow or shrink capacity instantly as your business needs change.
    
    Cloud computing also makes it easy to expand to new regions and deploy globally in minutes.
    
    For example, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has infrastructure all over the world so you're able to deploy your application in multiple physical locations in just a few clicks.
    
    Putting applications in closer proximity to end users reduces latency and improves their experience.
    
    No matter your location, size or industry, the cloud frees you from managing infrastructure and data centers so you can focus on what matter most to your business.

      <p>Public sector healthcare organizations around the world use Amazon Web Services (AWS) to analyze their data, improve patient care in the communities they serve, and empower teams with the tools needed to assess, diagnose, and treat in real time. Using AWS, healthcare organizations can reduce the time and effort required to run existing clinical and non-clinical workloads and provide access to new analytics capabilities and machine learning technologies that meet both regional and global security and privacy requirements.

### Why lock your business into AWS?
Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a substantial amount of Cloud services that can be used to perform simple computation operations for hobbyist software developers, or running highly complex application workloads with an enterprise grade Service Level Agreement (SLA).
The flexibility of using Amazon Web Services (AWS) with projects has deemed it a good choice of Cloud provider due to its Capital Expenditure (CapEx) pricing model. Taking the plunge to migrate application workloads to AWS is a decision that must be made with much thought but the exact answer for that decision depends on your current I.T setup and requirements.

### How much does AWS cost?
There is no definitive answer to what is the cost of AWS services as the needs and requirements of every enterprise of startup company will be different.
Part of our consultancy service is giving an estimated cost as to how much it will cost to operate your application workload(s) on AWS.
Some AWS services are free but some are charged at a rate defined by AWS.

What exactly is a Service Level Agreement (SLA)?
A service level agreement metric is the uptime guarantee of a service and is a term most commonly used in I.T Service Management (ITSM) professions.

Shouldn't I always choose a Service Level Agreement that's 100%?
Not necessarily. An uptime of 100% is extremely rare to come by. Even the shortest of application changes can occur *some* downtime for your users.

Why use Amazon Web Services?
- More cost effective than hosting & maintaining application workloads using on-premise hardware.


Promotes Machine Learning, Compute, Storage, and Analytics.

We can migrate data on a large scale using high performance devices with capacities of up to 5TB.
