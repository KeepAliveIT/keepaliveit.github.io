## About Keep-Alive I.T

### What does Keep-Alive I.T do?
We're a universal I.T Consultation company who has over a decade of specialist experience with developing Agile software, and keeping I.T systems operational.

Whether you're a small business who needs help designing & setting up a small Local Area Network (LAN), a medium sized company who wants to start selling a new range of products online via an in-house developed e-commerce platform, or a FTSE 100 company who requires expertise advice with a Cloud
migration strategy; Keep-Alive I.T will plan, consult, and implement I.T solutions for organisations of all size - no matter their technical literacy, or employee count.

### Where is Keep-Alive I.T based?
We're a UK company based in central Cardiff, Wales. Cardiff has excellent transport links to major Road and Rail services, and also 2 local airports - allowing us to easily reach England, Ireland, Scotland, or other parts of the World if required. We are able to travel to our clients, or work remotely - depending on the nature of the work that needs completing. 


### How much does Keep-Alive I.T charge for its I.T services?
We believe being transparent and open about our prices to our potential and current customers is the best way to establish a good working relationship and solid trust right from the start. 

This means you can easily get a good ballpark figure of our service costs ahead of time, avoiding you any nasty surprises at the end of our time working together. 

Each page of our website will give you an approximate cost for the service on offer. Some services will require further analysis into your requirements before we are able to agree on a price. This is the nature of consultancy services and what you should expect from us if you decide to work with us.

### What does the process of working with Keep Alive I.T involve?
This depends on the type of work you need completed. As a general rule, there are 7 steps involved in working with us:

1. You contact us and supply us with a description of the work that you need completed. This can be a one page document explaining what our deliverables should be from your project, or if you want us to work on a relatively new project, you should supply us with a detailed Brief or Design Document for your new idea.

2. We do some research and a brief technical review of the work you’ve supplied us with and let you know within a few days if it’s feasible and a piece of work we’re capable of taking on. At this stage, we’ll schedule a meeting with you to get to know your needs and requirements.

3. Once we’ve had a meeting with you, we’ll produce a contract for your work. This contract will contain a list of deliverables by us, as well as some legal terms that you’ll need to agree to and generally keeps both parties happy throughout the duration of the project.

4. We’ll send you the contract that’s been produced and once you’ve read through it, you’ll need to sign it electronically so work can begin. You’ll also need to send us any resources which can help us complete your work before any work can begin on your project (for example, if we’re making you a website you’ll need to send us appropriate branding materials).

5. This is where you can relax and our hard work begins. We’ll plan, design, develop, and test your work and contact you if we need any additional information or resources from you. Depending on the duration of the project, you might need to play the waiting game for some time. We’ll let you know how we’re getting on with the work at different stages of the project by SMS, email, or phone.

6. We’ll send you samples of the work we have produced so you can test it and give us feedback on the work. We’re able to make minor changes during this stage if there’s anything you’re not completely happy with.

7. This marks the end of our time working together. We’ll send you over the finished works, and hopefully we can work together at some point in the future.

You can find more specific details of how the flow works for each service we offer in the Client Forms section of the Keep Alive I.T website.
