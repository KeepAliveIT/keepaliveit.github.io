It’s a great honour for me to be able to write the very first blog post for the Keep-Alive I.T website. This is the result of months of detailed planning, writing, and testing; Alongside working a full-time day job to be able to fund establishing Keep-Alive I.T (or K.A.I.T as I like to refer to the company informally in conversations).   I’d like to take the time to write a brief introduction to Keep-Alive I.T explaining this new venture, our mission statement, and what the company hopes to bring myself and future clients in the medium-to-long term.   Who is ‘me’? Good question. My name is Joel Murphy and I am the founder of Keep-Alive I.T Services. I’ll be taking on the role of ‘Lead Consultant’ here within the company, whereby I’ll be working with clients to deliver I.T strategies, technical roadmaps, and functional I.T implementations with my expertise I.T &amp; business planning skills. In addition to taking on this role, I will also be working towards leading the company in a positive direction for the future. I forecast this to become somewhat of a hectic role that keeps me extremely occupied for the near year until our team hopefully grows bigger, but I honestly can’t wait to see what interesting work opportunities we can take on as a company.   Reasons for founding Keep-Alive I.T  I founded Keep-Alive I.T because I’ve worked in a range of different office environments in the Public and Private sector and seen some of the good and bad sides to different technology implementations at different organisations in both, Windows and Linux Operating System environments. Sure, not everyone gets things right first time but when you’re constantly seeing newbies (or people who think they’re experienced with something - when in reality they have absolutely no clue about) implementing old, dying technologies at a company just because they have a senior status without any redundancy or intention of scale, it makes you wonder if there’s any hope at all for running reliable systems in production. When you’re an employee at an organisation, you sort of learn to shut your mouth and go with whatever solution you’re told to work towards. Consulting on the other hand is a great opportunity to make use of the expert skills you’ve acquired after so many years working with different technologies and seeing them grow over time. With this in mind, it has motivated me to start a company consulting clients on Development and operations  As someone who keeps up to date with the latest and greatest technolgies, focuses on best practises, and practises development and operational I.T procedures; I see myself as a strong candidate for ‘bridging the gap’ between business and I.T workers and help break down complex technical problems into a language that others can easily understand. We take analysing your existing I.T infrastructure and software processes.   How I came up with the company name  If you’re a techy at heart, you may be aware of the HTTP Keep-Alive Header which is present in most modern web-browsers.      Keep alive is a method to allow the same tcp connection for HTTP conversation instead of opening a new one with each new request. More simply put, it is a communication between the web server and the web browser that says “you can grab more than just one file at a time”    Development and Operations support, I.T Procurement   Our base  Our registered office is based in the heart of Caerphilly, just a stones throw away from Cardiff.

That’s why we’ve created this Website Development Process to help describe the different stages of the development process and to understand how our working relationship is effective.   Phase 1: Knowledge &amp; Requirements Gathering  During the Knowledge &amp; Requirements Gathering phase, the customer (you), and the developer (us) will discuss the mission &amp; Unique Selling Point (USP) of your business or organisation. This will help both parties identify the customer needs and create a vision of what the customer hopes to achieve with their new Website. We’ll ask you some detailed questions about what your Website needs to do during this phase so that we have all the information we need to know. This will usually involve having a meeting in person - but don’t worry about this! We’ll throw some ideas at you if you get stuck during the meeting and it won’t be formal in any way.   Phase 2: Layout &amp; Design  Once the developer has a better understanding of the business or organisation’s requirements, the design work begins. Based on the information provided by the customer in Phase 1, the designer will create a design and send it to you for review. The design is worked on until you are 100% satisfied* and love the way it looks. Once we’re given the go ahead with our design, we’re ready to move onto Phase 3, which is the Implementation phase.   Phase 3: Implementation  Now that we have a final design and a clear picture of what the client wants, we can begin building the actual Website. The implementation phase consists of coding the required functionality of the Website, and implementing the design we came up with in Phase 2.  After this phase is complete, the Website comes to life and you can start using its features. This is the most time consuming phase of our time working together, so it may be some time before you hear back from us depending on your project size.   Phase 4: Feedback  Now that Website is ready, we want to hear your final feedback about it. If there’s anything that needs changing, we will make some last minute tweaks** to it before the Website goes ‘live’ for your company / customers/ organisation to use.   Phase 5: Launch &amp; Training  The new Website is now ready to be shown to the world! In the Launch &amp; Training phase, the website is made live for customers to see. Training is available to learn how to use the new Website. E.g. if we build you a Website which is built on a content management system, we will provide you with a short guide on how to use the system. This will allow you to update the Website’s content without knowledge of web coding.      Please ask us about our client satisfaction policy.   Software glitches (also known as bugs) may arise during the implementation phase. This can sometimes take more than just a few minutes to fix, but completely depends on the project. Please ask us about this.  ","categories": [],

Phase 5: Launch &amp; Training  The new Website is now ready to be shown to the world! In the Launch &amp; Training phase, the website is made live for customers to see. Training is available to learn how to use the new Website. E.g. if we build you a Website which is built on a content management system, we will provide you with a short guide on how to use the system. This will allow you to update the Website’s content without knowledge of web coding.      Please ask us about our client satisfaction policy.   Software glitches (also known as bugs) may arise during the implementation phase. This can sometimes take more than just a few minutes to fix, but completely depends on the project.

        "excerpt":"Website Development Checklist  Creating a new website may seem like an extremely stressful task for some people but proper planning will ensure that the process goes as smoothly as possible for all parties involved. That’s why we’ve created this Website Development Process to help describe the different stages of the development process and to understand how our working relationship is effective.   Phase 1: Knowledge &amp; Requirements Gathering  During the Knowledge &amp; Requirements Gathering phase, the customer (you), and the developer (us) will discuss the mission &amp; Unique Selling Point (USP) of your business or organisation. This will help both parties identify the customer needs and create a vision of what the customer hopes to achieve with their new Website. We’ll ask you some detailed questions about what your Website needs to do during this phase so that we have all the information we need to know. This will usually involve having a meeting in person - but don’t worry about this! We’ll throw some ideas at you if you get stuck during the meeting and it won’t be formal in any way.   Phase 2: Layout &amp; Design  Once the developer has a better understanding of the business or organisation’s requirements, the design work begins. Based on the information provided by the customer in Phase 1, the designer will create a design and send it to you for review. The design is worked on until you are 100% satisfied* and love the way it looks. Once we’re given the go ahead with our design, we’re ready to move onto Phase 3, which is the Implementation phase.   Phase 3: Implementation  Now that we have a final design and a clear picture of what the client wants, we can begin building the actual Website. The implementation phase consists of coding the required functionality of the Website, and implementing the design we came up with in Phase 2.  After this phase is complete, the Website comes to life and you can start using its features. This is the most time consuming phase of our time working together, so it may be some time before you hear back from us depending on your project size.   Phase 4: Feedback  Now that Website is ready, we want to hear your final feedback about it. If there’s anything that needs changing, we will make some last minute tweaks** to it before the Website goes ‘live’ for your company / customers/ organisation to use.   Phase 5: Launch &amp; Training  The new Website is now ready to be shown to the world! In the Launch &amp; Training phase, the website is made live for customers to see.
