    <li>
        <div>When will I hear back about my job application?</div>
        <div>
            When you send us your CV, we do our best to get back to you within 72 hours. But because of the number of applications we get, if you're not invited to an interview, we're afraid we can't offer feedback at this stage.
            If you've made it through to have a phone call or on-site interview, congratulations! We'll aim to get back to you within 72 hours.
