## Jobs at Keep-Alive I.T
Here at Keep-Alive I.T, our team must be equipped with the right skills to get the job done. It’s okay for a team member to be an expert at a particular task, but we try to get our entire team equipped with the skills needed to thrive in their jobs. This means all members of our team have at least some knowledge of working with digital technologies.

## **Wellbeing allowance of £300 per year**

We want to support you in your personal development outside of work, specifically in terms of learning new skills or challenging yourself in a way that is positive for your health and wellbeing.

We understand all employees aren't the same therefore we wouldn't expect everyone to take advantage of a subsidised gym membership for example. So, rather than limiting your choice, you can spend your allowance however you see fit as long as it fits within the parameters of health and wellbeing personal development.

We haven't come up with an exact definition of what this means, or an exhaustive list of examples. We would rather you come to us (your line manager or a Chief) with an idea and if it works then we will add it to the list below:

- gym membership
- classes (martial arts, cookery, dance, yoga, fitness, bootcamp, etc.)
- a weekend / week retreat with a focus on health and wellbeing

### **How much can I claim in the year?**

The maximum you can claim is £300 per calendar year. This can work out as £300 in a single month or £25 per month.

### **How do I make a claim?**

Upload a copy of invoice/receipt via Xero for finance to approve and pay. Employees must submit supporting documents by 10th working day from month end.

**Here is a link on how to submit an expense claim through Xero:** 

## **Professional development allowance of £500 per year**

Keep-Alive I.T supports employees’ professional development with an annual allowance of £500. 

The allowance could be used to attend a course, a conference or a networking event. If you can show that it will help you in your role at Keep-Alive I.T then we would be delighted to support you.

### **How much can I claim in the year?**

The £500 allowance is not a hard limit however the higher the cost, the greater the burden of proof that it will help you in your professional development and the more likely we will be to ask you to share your learnings with the wider company.

### **How do I make a claim?**

Please fill in this [form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lsC-KkDWvvylu2mdEXDwg9IZAV6PuHxZSidKgJCKCSE/edit) and submit it to your line manager.

## **Breakfast**

Every morning there is a breakfast spread free of cost. Let Charlotte, our Office Manager, know if you have any allergies or dietary restrictions.

**What you can expect from breakfast:**

- Healthy: We try to offer products that are not bad for you!
- Enough for everyone: The goal is to have enough food for everyone. But sometimes we just run out of stock, bad luck... No worries, we will get some more next time.
- Variety: Variation is good. But it's also good to keep some things special. Like luxury products or snacks, we order these occasionally. This should keep it special and within our budget.
- If you have any food related suggestions, send them to Charlotte in the #office channel
