<h2>The Keep-Alive I.T approach to I.T consultancy</h2>

Weâ€™re pretty good at all of these things and can apply our I.T knowledge to your requirements, or do things how we think they should be done, as experts in the I.T field who work with technology every single day and is familiar with I.T best practises.

<p>We understand not everyone is a 'tech wizzard' when it comes to dealing with I.T, so this is why we've written guides on how to perform common computing tasks. We hope our guides are a valuable learning resource and can help you take the 'DIY approach' to maintaining your I.T.</p>
