            - Healthy: We try to offer products that are not bad for you!
            - Enough for everyone: The goal is to have enough food for everyone. But sometimes we just run out of stock, bad luck... No worries, we will get some more next time.
            - Variety: Variation is good. But it's also good to keep some things special. Like luxury products or snacks, we order these occasionally. This should keep it special and within our budget.
            - If you have any food related suggestions, send them to Charlotte in the #office channel
