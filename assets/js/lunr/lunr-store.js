It’s a great honour for me to be able to write the very first blog post for the Keep-Alive I.T website. This is the result of months of detailed planning, writing, and testing; Alongside working a full-time day job to be able to fund establishing Keep-Alive I.T (or K.A.I.T as I like to refer to the company informally in conversations).   I’d like to take the time to write a brief introduction to Keep-Alive I.T explaining this new venture, our mission statement, and what the company hopes to bring myself and future clients in the medium-to-long term.   Who is ‘me’? Good question. My name is Joel Murphy and I am the founder of Keep-Alive I.T Services. I’ll be taking on the role of ‘Lead Consultant’ here within the company, whereby I’ll be working with clients to deliver I.T strategies, technical roadmaps, and functional I.T implementations with my expertise I.T &amp; business planning skills. In addition to taking on this role, I will also be working towards leading the company in a positive direction for the future. I forecast this to become somewhat of a hectic role that keeps me extremely occupied for the near year until our team hopefully grows bigger, but I honestly can’t wait to see what interesting work opportunities we can take on as a company.   Reasons for founding Keep-Alive I.T  I founded Keep-Alive I.T because I’ve worked in a range of different office environments in the Public and Private sector and seen some of the good and bad sides to different technology implementations at different organisations in both, Windows and Linux Operating System environments. Sure, not everyone gets things right first time but when you’re constantly seeing newbies (or people who think they’re experienced with something - when in reality they have absolutely no clue about) implementing old, dying technologies at a company just because they have a senior status without any redundancy or intention of scale, it makes you wonder if there’s any hope at all for running reliable systems in production. When you’re an employee at an organisation, you sort of learn to shut your mouth and go with whatever solution you’re told to work towards. Consulting on the other hand is a great opportunity to make use of the expert skills you’ve acquired after so many years working with different technologies and seeing them grow over time. With this in mind, it has motivated me to start a company consulting clients on Development and operations  As someone who keeps up to date with the latest and greatest technolgies, focuses on best practises, and practises development and operational I.T procedures; I see myself as a strong candidate for ‘bridging the gap’ between business and I.T workers and help break down complex technical problems into a language that others can easily understand. We take analysing your existing I.T infrastructure and software processes.   How I came up with the company name  If you’re a techy at heart, you may be aware of the HTTP Keep-Alive Header which is present in most modern web-browsers.      Keep alive is a method to allow the same tcp connection for HTTP conversation instead of opening a new one with each new request. More simply put, it is a communication between the web server and the web browser that says “you can grab more than just one file at a time”    Development and Operations support, I.T Procurement   Our base  Our registered office is based in the heart of Caerphilly, just a stones throw away from Cardiff.

That’s why we’ve created this Website Development Process to help describe the different stages of the development process and to understand how our working relationship is effective.   Phase 1: Knowledge &amp; Requirements Gathering  During the Knowledge &amp; Requirements Gathering phase, the customer (you), and the developer (us) will discuss the mission &amp; Unique Selling Point (USP) of your business or organisation. This will help both parties identify the customer needs and create a vision of what the customer hopes to achieve with their new Website. We’ll ask you some detailed questions about what your Website needs to do during this phase so that we have all the information we need to know. This will usually involve having a meeting in person - but don’t worry about this! We’ll throw some ideas at you if you get stuck during the meeting and it won’t be formal in any way.   Phase 2: Layout &amp; Design  Once the developer has a better understanding of the business or organisation’s requirements, the design work begins. Based on the information provided by the customer in Phase 1, the designer will create a design and send it to you for review. The design is worked on until you are 100% satisfied* and love the way it looks. Once we’re given the go ahead with our design, we’re ready to move onto Phase 3, which is the Implementation phase.   Phase 3: Implementation  Now that we have a final design and a clear picture of what the client wants, we can begin building the actual Website. The implementation phase consists of coding the required functionality of the Website, and implementing the design we came up with in Phase 2.  After this phase is complete, the Website comes to life and you can start using its features. This is the most time consuming phase of our time working together, so it may be some time before you hear back from us depending on your project size.   Phase 4: Feedback  Now that Website is ready, we want to hear your final feedback about it. If there’s anything that needs changing, we will make some last minute tweaks** to it before the Website goes ‘live’ for your company / customers/ organisation to use.   Phase 5: Launch &amp; Training  The new Website is now ready to be shown to the world! In the Launch &amp; Training phase, the website is made live for customers to see. Training is available to learn how to use the new Website. E.g. if we build you a Website which is built on a content management system, we will provide you with a short guide on how to use the system. This will allow you to update the Website’s content without knowledge of web coding.      Please ask us about our client satisfaction policy.   Software glitches (also known as bugs) may arise during the implementation phase. This can sometimes take more than just a few minutes to fix, but completely depends on the project. Please ask us about this.  ","categories": [],

That’s why we’ve created this Website Development Process to help describe the different stages of the development process and to understand how our working relationship is effective.   Phase 1: Knowledge &amp; Requirements Gathering  During the Knowledge &amp; Requirements Gathering phase, the customer (you), and the developer (us) will discuss the mission &amp; Unique Selling Point (USP) of your business or organisation.

Android Phones are subject to malware (a shortened term used to describe malicious software). ot updating software on an Android Phone could leave an Android Phone exposed to security vulnerabilities and subject to being a victim of being infected by viruses. Computer viruses are a type of Software that can be used to make computing devices perform illegal activities over the internet. This can occur on a single device, or across an entire network of devices if the malware is sophisticated enough to cause severe damage.   We won’t go into too much detail on how computer viruses are created &amp; operate as this is beyond the scope of this guide. However, a key point to make you aware of is that Software viruses can load &amp; execute themselves onto an Android Phone with or without your knowledge. This is done by taking advantage of security holes left in software that has been partially developed &amp; tested, or patched incorrectly. Viruses come in different forms and some can be more severe to your devices than others, depending on the complexity of the the malicious software and how it exploits the security hole that exists on your device, or its network.   Groups of people, or individuals who have the intent of performing malicious acts by using your computing resource(s) are known as ‘hackers’. Hackers are malicious people who have the intent of stealing your personal information, or using your device’s computing power to attack other devices on a network to ‘hack’ others.  This process (known as ‘hacking’) is in breach of the computer misuse act and is highly illegal.   Being ‘hacked’ should be a high risk factor for anyone that owns a computing device.  It may seem like we’re preaching about Android Phone security but please don’t fret, as the process of applying software updates to an Android Phone is actually a lot simpler than it seems. Applying Software updates is also one of the most effective ways of protecting against viruses and maintaining your cyber resilience efforts. Keeping an Android Phone updated keeps you one step ahead of hackers and mitigates the possibility of an Android Phone being compromised by malicious software.   So to reiterate, taking proactive measures towards keeping software updated is one of the few thing consumers can do to ensure their devices aren’t exposed to malware and cyber attacks. By upgrading the Software on your Mac you’ll avoid issues such as Corruption of an Android Phone hard drive, Losing your work, or having confidential information stolen. Now that you’ve learned why it is important to keep an Android Phone updated, we will show you how to update the Mac OS Software on an Android Phone.   How to update the Mac OS Software on an Android Phone   Step 0 - Prerequisites  As a prerequisite, make sure you have enough hard drive or solid state drive storage available to install a software update on your Android Phone. You can check Apple’s website for more information about the size of Mac OS updates. You must also connect an Android Phone to a power outlet to ensure your Android Phone has enough power to apply and complete the software update procedure successfully.   Step 1 - Click the Apple Icon in the top left of MacOS to reveal the ‘Apple menu’  It doesn’t matter which window you currently have in focus within Mac OS as the Apple Icon will always be visible unless you have a software application open in a maximised state. If this is the case then please hover your mouse cursor near the top left of the Window to reveal the Apple logo. Simply click the Apple icon to display a context menu that looks like the following:     Step 2 - Open up ‘System Preferences’ from the MacOS Window  This is some text     Step 3 - Allow some time for MacOS to check for system updates.  If there are no updates available, then MacOS will display a message and you can safely continue to use your Android Phone as usual.     Step 4  This is some text     Step 5  You will need to agree to the MacOS license agreement. Please read through this carefully and then click the ‘Agree’ button if you agree to the terms.     &lt;!–&lt;div class=\"divider div-transparent div-arrow-down\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   That’s the end of the process. You may now sit back and wait for the update to complete. Your Mac may restart several times throughout the update process, so don’t panic if this happens.   Quick Tip:  It’s possible for an Android Phone to check for software updates automatically, which automates the process above. This is a feature we’d suggest enabling to save you the hassle of having to check for software updates manually, and to maintain a consistent level of security for an Android Phone.   Thanks for reading - still stuck, or too lazy to complete the process yourself?  We hope this guide has served you well and you are now able to update the Software on an Android Phone without any issues.

How to update the Mac OS Software on a Macbook   Step 0 - Prerequisites  As a prerequisite, make sure you have enough hard drive or solid state drive storage available to install a software update on your Macbook. You can check Apple’s website for more information about the size of Mac OS updates. You must also connect a Macbook to a power outlet to ensure your Macbook has enough power to apply and complete the software update procedure successfully.   Step 1 - Click the Apple Icon in the top left of MacOS to reveal the ‘Apple menu’  It doesn’t matter which window you currently have in focus within Mac OS as the Apple Icon will always be visible unless you have a software application open in a maximised state. If this is the case then please hover your mouse cursor near the top left of the Window to reveal the Apple logo. Simply click the Apple icon to display a context menu that looks like the following:      Step 2 - Open up ‘System Preferences’ from the MacOS Window  This is some text      Step 3 - Allow some time for MacOS to check for system updates.  If there are no updates available, then MacOS will display a message and you can safely continue to use your Macbook as usual.      Step 4  This is some text      Step 5  You will need to agree to the MacOS license agreement. Please read through this carefully and then click the ‘Agree’ button if you agree to the terms.        That’s the end of the process. You may now sit back and wait for the update to complete. Your Mac may restart several times throughout the update process, so don’t panic if this happens.   Quick Tip:  It’s possible for a Macbook to check for software updates automatically, which automates the process above. This is a feature we’d suggest enabling to save you the hassle of having to check for software updates manually, and to maintain a consistent level of security for a Macbook.   Thanks for reading - still stuck, or too lazy to complete the process yourself?  We hope this guide has served you well and you are now able to update the Software on a Macbook without any issues.

One popular misconception people have about Macbooks (and Macs in general) is that “Macs don’t get viruses”. This leads consumers to believe that there isn’t a need to keep on top of updating Mac OS on a Macbook and that Macbooks are invincible to malware (a shortened term used to describe malicious Software). In fact, the situation is the complete opposite to this as Macs CAN get viruses and the outcome of not updating Software on a Macbook could mean the device may become vulnerable to being infected by viruses. Computer viruses can compromise a single device, or an entire network of devices if the malware is sophisticated enough to cause a significant amount of damage.   Understanding how computer viruses are created &amp; operate is beyond the scope of this guide. However, a key point to make you aware of is that Software viruses can load &amp; execute themselves onto a Macbook with or without your knowledge if it is able to bypass Operating System security policies. This is done by taking advantage of security holes left in Software that has been partially developed, or incorrectly tested. Attack vectors can also be created when Software is misconfigured, or patched incorrectly. Viruses come in different forms and some can be more severe to your devices than others, depending on the complexity of the the malicious Software and how it exploits the security hole that exists on your device, or its network.   Groups of people, or individuals who have the intent of performing malicious acts by using your computing resource(s), or stealing your information are known as ‘hackers’. Hackers are malicious people who have the intent of stealing your personal information, or using your device’s computing power to attack other devices on a network to ‘hack’ others.  This process (known as ‘hacking’) is highly illegal, and is in breach of the computer use act &amp; Data Protection Laws.   Being ‘hacked’ should be a high risk factor for anyone that owns a computing device.  It may seem like we’re preaching about Macbook security but please don’t fret, as the process of applying Software updates to a Macbook is actually a lot simpler than it seems. Applying Software updates is one of the most effective ways of protecting against viruses and maintaining your cyber resilience efforts. This is because keeping a Macbook updated keeps you one step ahead of hackers and mitigates the possibility of a Macbook being compromised by malicious software.   So to reiterate, taking proactive measures towards keeping Software updated is one of the few things consumers may do to ensure their devices aren’t exposed to malware and cyber attacks.

If there are no updates available, then MacOS will display a message and you can safely continue to use your Macbook as usual.      Step 4 - Perform the Software update  If an update is ready to install on your Macbook, you may proceed to installing the software update by clicking on the ‘Update Now’ button.      Step 5  You will need to agree to the MacOS license agreement. Please read through this carefully and then click the ‘Agree’ button if you agree to the terms.        That’s the end of the process.
